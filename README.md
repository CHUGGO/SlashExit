# SlashExit
This is a simple plugin for Dalamud/FFXIV that allows you to exit the game using a slash command. It also provides options to kill ACT and Triggevent when exiting.

### Usage:
| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| /exit | Exit the game (and optionally ACT, Triggevent) |
| /exitACT | Toggle killing ACT |
| /exitTrigg | Toggle killing Triggevent |

By default, the plugin will kill ACT and Triggevent when exiting. You can toggle this behavior using the `/exitACT` and `/exitTrigg` commands.
